# Forecasting stock prices with sentiment analysis and deep learning
Hello, thank you for your interest in this project. When I was in the military, these were my way of keeping sane in my barracks room. Ultimately, I wanted to see if I could code something "useful" that I could turn into an MVP someday and further my understanding of software development, AI methodologies, and the fintech sector. The cumulation of these pursuits can be found in [Main_Pipelines](https://github.com/aidan-lew/Stock_Price_Forecaster/tree/main/Main_Pipleines) with the optimizations, visualizations, and other cumbersome testing notebooks can be found in [Testing_Pipelines](https://github.com/aidan-lew/Stock_Price_Forecaster/tree/main/Main_Pipleines). Please reach out with any questions at <aidanlew64@gmail.com>. Enjoy!
